# Snake
A Snake game, created in the course Introduction to Programming at Jönköping University during early 2015. 

This was the first project I worked with during my time at Jönköping University.
Introduction to Programming was the first programming course, at this point we did't know about Object Oriented programming so be aware of that if reading the code.

This project got us the highest grade possible! :)
